# xenuSpaceBattle

Read the original [https://github.com/johnrigler/thetanAtRest/] for some context about this

In this variant, the participant will move through a guided time travel space opera. You will travel back 75 billion year and participate in a hollywood hero quest 
that will culminate in single-handedly stopping Xenu before he can carry out his evil plan. 

The Xenu mythos is pretty well documented at this point. So this branch needs to add something to the mix. It could stretch the limits of what a README can do. I 
am thinking that this should be like a Zork adventure where you go travel into the distant past and to a faraway planet, but are still bound by the physical
limitations of the game map. That map could be stared in a Base58 tablet.

For now, this whole universe in three rooms:


              guard room -> throme room -> computer room

Resolution is found by getting past the guards, seeing Xenu, hearing his speech, and then racing into the computer room as a countdown is taking place.
You can just flip a switch to stop the system and foil his plans. Then your world begins to swirl around and you are returned to the present.

The experience is designed to bring emotional resolution.
